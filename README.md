# WebCrawler

This is a web crawler, which given a particular website, can crawl all the internal links in the site. It uses a BFS algorithm to process the links found in the pages.
It also uses multiprocessing in Python in order to process multiple links at the same time. There is also a Dynamic N-ary Tree class which can build an N-ary tree (with
varying size N) to represent the site.
